My favorites are:
* `RadioCommercials` - Kadane's algorithm is powerful, simple and beautiful at the same time.
* `MailboxManufacturersProblem` - Mathematics, recursion, arithmetic progressions!
* `Pripreme` - When you thought it's knapsack but it turned out to be O(N).
* `UnionFind` - I spent an hour fighting with _Time Limit Exceeded_ in all imaginable ways until I found that harmless-looking `switch` statement was the reason of running slow.
* `Game2048` - saying there is game development in my github.
